## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1 completion:

- Backend API endpoints are fully operational and tested
- Search functionality is working with hybrid search (semantic + lexical)
- Upload and ingestion pipeline is complete with all 8 chunking methods
- API contracts are well-defined with comprehensive error handling
- Performance targets are met with <200ms p95 latency for search

### Data Models

**API Request/Response Models:**

**Upload Request:**

- `POST /api/upload` - multipart form with `file`, `doc_title`, `chunk_method` ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} [Source: architecture/10-api-contracts-examples.md#101]
- Response: `{ "doc_id": "doc_01HFX…", "ingestion_id": "ing_01HFX…" }` [Source: architecture/10-api-contracts-examples.md#101]

**Status Response:**

- `GET /api/ingestions/{id}` returns: `{ "id": "ing_01HFX…", "doc_id": "doc_01HFX…", "status": "indexing", "counts": { "chunks": 128, "vectors": 128 }, "blocked_reason": null, "errors": [] }` [Source: architecture/10-api-contracts-examples.md#102]

**Search Response:**

- `GET /api/search?q=...` returns: `{ "params": { "topk_vec": 20, "topk_lex": 20, "w_sem": 0.6, "w_lex": 0.4 }, "latency_ms": 420, "results": [ { "doc_id": "doc_01HFX…", "chunk_id": "ch_00045", "method": 4, "page_from": 2, "page_to": 3, "snippet": "…", "score": 0.82 } ] }` [Source: architecture/10-api-contracts-examples.md#103]

### API Specifications

**Backend API Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/upload` — multipart; params: `chunk_method` (enum), `doc_title` [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]
- `GET /api/ingestions/{id}` — status + counts [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]
- `GET /api/search?q=...` — hybrid query; returns ranked results with `{doc, chunk_id, method, snippet, score, page/section}` [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]

**Data Flow:**

1. Upload → validate size/type → persist original → enqueue ingest(job) [Source: architecture/3-highlevel-design-snapshot.md#33-data-flow]
2. Ingest(job) → extract text/structure → chunk (selected method) → embed → write Qdrant vectors + DB metadata/FTS → mark status [Source: architecture/3-highlevel-design-snapshot.md#33-data-flow]
3. Search → (optional) embed query → vector K=20 + lexical K=20 → fuse (0.6/0.4) → return top 10 with attributions [Source: architecture/3-highlevel-design-snapshot.md#33-data-flow]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-25

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation with strong TypeScript typing, modern React patterns, and comprehensive error handling. The code demonstrates good separation of concerns with a centralized API service layer and well-structured components. All components follow React best practices with proper hooks usage and state management.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/services/api.ts`

  - **Change**: Fixed IngestionStatus interface - changed `id` field from `number` to `string` to match API response
  - **Why**: Type mismatch was causing runtime errors and potential crashes
  - **How**: Updated interface definition to align with actual API response structure

- **File**: `src/services/api.ts`

  - **Change**: Enhanced API base URL configuration with additional environment variable fallback
  - **Why**: Improved deployment flexibility and configuration management
  - **How**: Added VITE_API_URL as additional fallback option for different deployment scenarios

- **File**: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
  - **Change**: Created new ErrorBoundary component for application-wide error handling
  - **Why**: No error boundary existed to catch and handle React component errors
  - **How**: Implemented class-based error boundary with user-friendly error display and development debugging info

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Modern React/TypeScript patterns, consistent formatting, no linting errors
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper component organization, service layer separation, test co-location
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit, integration, and accessibility tests with Vitest
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed type mismatch in IngestionStatus interface (src/services/api.ts)
- [x] Enhanced API configuration flexibility (src/services/api.ts)
- [x] Added ErrorBoundary component for better error handling (src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx)
- [ ] Consider adding ErrorBoundary tests for complete coverage
- [ ] Consider adding CSP headers for enhanced security
- [ ] Consider adding performance monitoring for production deployment

### Security Review

Strong security implementation with proper file upload validation, input sanitization, and XSS protection through React's built-in mechanisms. File type and size validation prevents malicious uploads. No critical security vulnerabilities identified.

### Performance Considerations

Well-optimized implementation with React Query for efficient data fetching, smart polling that stops on completion, and proper loading states. Bundle size is optimized through Vite. No performance bottlenecks identified.
