# Story 10.3: Add Dependency and Configuration

## User Story

As a **system administrator deploying the application**,
I want **the reranking feature to have proper dependency management and configuration**,
So that **the system can be deployed reliably with the new reranking capability**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Requirements management (`requirements.txt`), configuration system (`app/core/config.py`)
- Technology: pip dependencies, environment variable configuration, existing dependency patterns
- Follows pattern: Dependency version pinning pattern, environment-based configuration pattern
- Touch points: requirements.txt, configuration settings, deployment environment

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Dependency Management**: Verify existing `sentence-transformers==5.1.0` supports cross-encoder functionality (no upgrade needed)
2. **Configuration Parameters**: Add configuration parameters for reranking defaults (top_k=50, top_r=10, batch_size=16, max_chars=2000) to config system
3. **Environment Variables**: Add optional environment variables for reranking configuration with sensible defaults

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing dependency management continues to work unchanged
5. New configuration follows existing environment variable pattern
6. Integration with existing configuration system maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Dependency changes are backward compatible
8. Configuration is properly documented and has sensible defaults
9. No regression in existing deployment process verified through testing

## Technical Implementation

### Dependency Updates

```txt
# No changes needed - existing sentence-transformers==5.1.0 supports cross-encoders
# sentence-transformers==5.1.0  # Already present and compatible
```

### Configuration Parameters

```python
# Add to app/core/config.py
class Settings:
    # Reranking configuration
    rerank_top_k: int = 50
    rerank_top_r: int = 10
    rerank_batch_size: int = 16
    rerank_max_chars: int = 2000
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional environment variables with defaults
RERANK_TOP_K=50
RERANK_TOP_R=10
RERANK_BATCH_SIZE=16
RERANK_MAX_CHARS=2000
```

### Configuration Integration

- **Settings Class**: Add reranking parameters to existing Settings class
- **Environment Loading**: Use existing environment variable loading pattern
- **Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults for all parameters
- **Documentation**: Update configuration documentation

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Update requirements.txt with version constraint, add configuration parameters to settings
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows same dependency and configuration patterns used throughout the application
- **Key Constraints:** Maintain backward compatibility, use sensible defaults, follow existing configuration patterns

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met (configuration added in Story 10.1)
- [x] Integration requirements verified (no breaking changes)
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested (Story 10.1 verified compatibility)
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards (Pydantic Settings pattern used)
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new) - Story 10.1 tests cover configuration
- [x] Documentation updated if applicable (config defaults documented in code)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** No dependency changes needed - existing sentence-transformers==5.1.0 is compatible
- **Mitigation:** No dependency changes required - existing version supports cross-encoders
- **Rollback:** No rollback needed since no dependency changes are made

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [x] Performance impact is negligible

## Estimated Effort

1-2 story points

## Status

**Done** - Configuration was already implemented in Story 10.1

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Automatically completed during Story 10.1 implementation

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1**: Verify sentence-transformers dependency compatibility
  - [x] Confirmed existing sentence-transformers==5.1.0 supports cross-encoders
  - [x] No dependency upgrade needed
- [x] **Task 2**: Add configuration parameters to config system
  - [x] Added rerank_top_k, rerank_top_r, rerank_batch_size, rerank_max_chars to config.py
  - [x] Set sensible defaults matching story requirements
- [x] **Task 3**: Integration verification
  - [x] Configuration integrated with existing Settings class
  - [x] No regression in existing deployment process
  - [x] Backward compatibility maintained

### Completion Notes List

- All configuration parameters were added during Story 10.1 implementation (app/core/config.py lines 33-36)
- No dependency changes needed - existing sentence-transformers version is compatible
- Configuration follows existing patterns with sensible defaults
- All acceptance criteria met through Story 10.1 work

### File List

**Modified Files:**

- `app/core/config.py` - Added reranking configuration parameters (already done in Story 10.1)

**Note:** This story's requirements were automatically fulfilled during Story 10.1, which implemented the complete reranking service including all necessary configuration.
