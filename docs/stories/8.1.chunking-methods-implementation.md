### Data Models

**Chunking Method Schema:**

- Method ID: Integer (1-8) representing chunking method [Source: docs/architecture/10-api-contracts-examples.md]
- Method tracking in ingestions table: `method INTEGER NOT NULL` [Source: docs/architecture/9-data-model.md#91-relational-schema-postgres]
- Chunk metadata includes method: `method INTEGER NOT NULL` in chunks table [Source: docs/architecture/9-data-model.md#91-relational-schema-postgres]

**Chunking Method Definitions:**

1. Fixed token windows (sliding) - Configurable window size with overlap
2. Sentence-based - Natural sentence boundary detection
3. Paragraph-based - Paragraph boundary detection
4. Semantic similarity-driven - Keyword-based semantic boundaries (enhanced with embedding-based similarity)
5. Sliding window - Fixed-size sliding window with configurable step
6. Recursive character/token splitter - Recursive splitting with size limits
7. Topic-based (Markdown/HTML) - Topic detection using heuristics and structure
8. Adaptive - Content-aware adaptive chunking

### API Specifications

**Upload API Integration:**

- Upload endpoint: `POST /api/upload` with `chunk_method` parameter (1-8) [Source: docs/architecture/10-api-contracts-examples.md]
- Request format: multipart `file`, `doc_title`, `chunk_method` ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} [Source: docs/architecture/10-api-contracts-examples.md]
- Chunking method selection at upload time [Source: docs/architecture/3-highlevel-design-snapshot.md#331-sequence-added]

**Ingestion Worker Integration:**

- Ingestion worker applies chosen chunker: "Extracts text → applies chosen chunker → generates embeddings" [Source: docs/architecture/3-highlevel-design-snapshot.md#31-services-mvp-minimalism]
- Chunking happens in ingestion pipeline: "Ingest(job) → extract text/structure → chunk (selected method)" [Source: docs/architecture/3-highlevel-design-snapshot.md#33-data-flow]

### Component Specifications

**Chunking Service Architecture:**

- Service location: `app/services/chunking.py` (new file to create)
- Integration with existing ingestion worker in `app/services/ingestion.py`
- Method registry pattern for extensible chunking methods
- Error handling and validation for chunking methods

**Text Processing Requirements:**

- Text processing and segmentation algorithms [Source: docs/epics/epic-8-chunking-methods-implementation.md#technical-requirements]
