## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.1 completion:

- Frontend project structure is established with React/TypeScript/Vite
- API service layer exists with axios configuration
- Error handling patterns are well-established
- Comprehensive testing framework is in place with Vitest
- All existing API endpoints are working and tested

### Data Models

**Authentication Database Schema:**

- User table: `id`, `email` (unique), `password_hash`, `organization_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` [Source: architecture/9-data-model.md#91-relational-schema-postgres]
- Organization table: `id`, `name`, `created_at` (single-tenant scoping) [Source: architecture/9-data-model.md#91-relational-schema-postgres]
- JWT tokens stored in memory/Redis for validation (no persistent storage needed) [Source: architecture/3-highlevel-design-snapshot.md#35-security-mvp]

**API Request/Response Models:**

- Registration: `POST /api/auth/register` with `{email, password, confirm_password}` [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]
- Login: `POST /api/auth/login` with `{email, password}` → `{access_token, refresh_token, user_id, organization_id}` [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]
- Logout: `POST /api/auth/logout` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]

### API Specifications

**Authentication Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/auth/register` — email/password registration with validation [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]
- `POST /api/auth/login` — secure login with JWT token response [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — token invalidation and session cleanup [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]
- `GET /api/auth/me` — get current user information [Source: architecture/4-api-draft-trimmed-for-mvp.md]

**Security Requirements:**

- Password hashing with bcrypt/argon2 [Source: architecture/13-rate-limiting-security-notes.md]
- JWT validation in non-local environments [Source: architecture/13-rate-limiting-security-notes.md]
- HTTPS enforcement for non-local environments [Source: architecture/3-highlevel-design-snapshot.md#35-security-mvp]
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 QPS) [Source: architecture/13-rate-limiting-security-notes.md]

### Component Specifications

**Frontend Authentication Components:**

- LoginForm: Email/password input with validation and error handling
- RegisterForm: Email/password/confirm password with validation
- AuthContext: React context for authentication state management
- ProtectedRoute: HOC for protecting routes that require authentication
- AuthGuard: Component wrapper for conditional rendering based on auth state

**Authentication Flow:**

1. User registers with email/password → backend creates user with hashed password
2. User logs in → backend validates credentials → returns JWT tokens
3. Frontend stores tokens and includes in API requests
4. Backend validates JWT on protected endpoints
5. User logs out → tokens are invalidated

### File Locations

**Backend Authentication Structure:**

- Models: `app/models/auth.py` (User, Organization models)
- Services: `app/services/auth.py` (password hashing, JWT management)
- Routes: `app/api/routes/auth.py` (authentication endpoints)
- Middleware: `app/middleware/auth.py` (JWT validation middleware)
- Schemas: `app/schemas/auth.py` (Pydantic models for auth requests/responses)

**Frontend Authentication Structure:**

- Components: `src/components/auth/` (LoginForm, RegisterForm, AuthGuard)
- Context: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (authentication state management)
- Services: `src/services/auth.ts` (authentication API calls)
- Pages: `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`, `src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx`
- Hooks: `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` (authentication hook)

**Integration Points:**

- Update existing API service to include authentication headers
- Modify existing routes to require authentication where needed
- Add authentication state to main app layout

### Testing Requirements

**Backend Testing:**

- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_auth_*.py`, `tests/integration/test_auth_*.py`
- Testing frameworks: pytest with FastAPI TestClient
- Test database: Use test.db for isolated testing

- Claims: user_id, organization_id, email, iat, exp

**Organization Scoping:**

- Single-tenant per deployment [Source: architecture/2-constraints-assumptions.md]
- All user data scoped to organization
- No cross-organization data access
- Organization created automatically on first user registration

**Rate Limiting:**

- Auth endpoints: 5 requests per minute per IP
- Login attempts: 3 failed attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Registration: 1 per minute per IP
- Use existing rate limiting infrastructure

**Error Handling:**

- Follow existing error model with JSON envelope [Source: architecture/7-error-model-json.md]
- HTTP status codes: 400 (validation), 401 (unauthorized), 403 (forbidden), 409 (conflict), 429 (rate limited)
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- No information leakage in error responses

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - This is a high-quality implementation of a comprehensive authentication and authorization system. The code demonstrates strong architectural patterns, excellent test coverage, and adherence to security best practices. The implementation is well-structured with clear separation of concerns between backend services, API endpoints, and frontend components.

**Key Strengths:**

- Comprehensive JWT-based authentication with access/refresh token pattern
- Strong password security with bcrypt hashing and validation
- Well-designed database models with proper relationships
- Excellent test coverage across all layers (unit, integration, frontend)
- Clean separation of concerns and maintainable code structure
- Proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `app/services/auth.py`

  - **Change**: Replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
  - **Why**: `datetime.utcnow()` is deprecated and can cause timezone issues
  - **How**: Ensures consistent UTC timezone handling for JWT token expiration

- **File**: `app/schemas/auth.py`

  - **Change**: Added missing `message` field to `AuthResponse` schema
  - **Why**: The logout endpoint references this field but it wasn't defined
  - **How**: Prevents runtime errors and ensures API consistency

- **File**: `app/api/routes/auth.py`
  - **Change**: Added rate limiting infrastructure and client IP detection
  - **Why**: Security requirement for auth endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
  - **How**: Provides foundation for implementing proper rate limiting
