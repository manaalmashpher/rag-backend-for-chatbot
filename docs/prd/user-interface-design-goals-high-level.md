# User Interface Design Goals (High-Level)

- **Primary flows**: (1) **Upload & Ingest** with method selection; (2) **Search & Results** with source snippets and metadata; (3) **Answer Generation** with synthesized responses.
- **Information architecture**: Minimal navigationâ€”top-level tabs or sections for **Upload**, **Ingestion Status**, and **Search**.
- **Feedback & Errors**: Clear progress and completion states; explicit messages for blocked formats (e.g., scanned PDFs) and failed steps.
- **Method visibility**: Surface chosen chunking method and key preprocessing details in status and result views.
- **Answer Display**: Present both raw search results and synthesized answers with clear source attribution.
- **Accessibility & i18n**: English-only now; plan for RTL/i18n post-MVP.
