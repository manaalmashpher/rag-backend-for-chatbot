## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

- All high-priority epics are completed
- Quality targets are met (Q1 ≥ 0.70, Q2 ≥ 0.85, Q3 ≥ 3/5, Answer relevance ≥ 4/5)
- Performance targets are achieved (p95 ≤ 1.5s, p99 ≤ 3.0s, Answer generation p95 ≤ 3s)
- Ingestion throughput meets requirements (200-300 pages ≤ 20 min)
- Users can complete the upload→ingest→search→answer flow without assistance

## Notes

- Epics are ordered by priority and logical dependencies
- High-priority epics are essential for MVP functionality
- Medium-priority epics are important but not blocking
- Epic 9 (LLM Integration) depends on Epic 2 (Hybrid Search) and enhances the user experience
- Effort estimates are in story points and should be refined during sprint planning
