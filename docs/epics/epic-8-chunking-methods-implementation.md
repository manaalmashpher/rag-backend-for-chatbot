# Epic 8: Chunking Methods Implementation

## Epic Overview

Implement the eight predefined chunking methods that users can select when uploading documents, providing different strategies for document segmentation.

## Business Value

- Enables users to optimize document processing for different content types
- Provides flexibility in how documents are segmented for better retrieval
- Supports evaluation of different chunking strategies

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to choose from different chunking methods so I can optimize for my document type
- As a user, I want to see which chunking method was used so I can understand the results
- As a system, I want to apply the selected chunking method consistently so processing is reliable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement fixed token windows (sliding) chunking
- [ ] Implement sentence-based chunking
- [ ] Implement paragraph-based chunking
- [ ] Implement heading-aware chunking (Markdown/HTML)
- [ ] Implement semantic similarity-driven chunking
- [ ] Implement recursive character/token splitter
- [ ] Implement table/page/layout-aware chunking (for PDFs)
- [ ] Implement hybrid hierarchical chunking
- [ ] Support method selection at upload time
- [ ] Track chunking method in metadata

## Technical Requirements

- Text processing and segmentation algorithms
- Tokenization and parsing libraries
- PDF layout analysis (for method 7)
- Semantic similarity calculations
- Hierarchical document structure analysis
- Metadata tracking and storage

## Dependencies

- Text processing libraries
- PDF parsing capabilities
- Embedding models for semantic chunking
- Document structure analysis tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 8 chunking methods are implemented and tested
- [ ] Methods handle different document types appropriately
- [ ] Chunking method is tracked in metadata
- [ ] Methods produce consistent and reliable results
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for all methods
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases

## Priority

High - Core MVP functionality

## Estimated Effort

Large (8-13 story points)
