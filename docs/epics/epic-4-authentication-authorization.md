# Epic 4: Authentication & Authorization

## Epic Overview

Implement basic email/password authentication with single-tenant organization scoping to provide secure access to the system.

## Business Value

- Ensures secure access to user documents and search capabilities
- Provides foundation for future multi-user and multi-tenant features
- Enables proper data isolation and security

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to create an account with email and password so I can access the system
- As a user, I want to log in securely so I can access my documents
- As a user, I want my data to be isolated from other users so my information is private
- As a user, I want to log out so I can secure my session

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement email/password registration
- [ ] Implement secure login with session management
- [ ] Support single-tenant organization scoping
- [ ] Implement secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- [ ] Provide JWT-based session management
- [ ] Support HTTPS in non-local environments
- [ ] Implement logout functionality
- [ ] Validate sessions on protected endpoints

## Technical Requirements

- User registration and login endpoints
