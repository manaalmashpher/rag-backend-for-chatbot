# Epic 5: Backend API & Services

## Epic Overview

Develop the core backend services including API endpoints, ingestion workers, and hybrid search service to support the document processing and retrieval functionality.

## Business Value

- Provides the technical foundation for all system functionality
- Enables scalable and maintainable backend architecture
- Supports the complete document processing pipeline

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want well-defined API endpoints so I can integrate with the frontend
- As a system, I want reliable ingestion workers so documents are processed correctly
- As a system, I want efficient search services so queries return results quickly
- As an operator, I want health checks so I can monitor system status

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement REST API endpoints for upload, status, and search
- [ ] Create ingestion worker service for document processing
- [ ] Build hybrid search service for query processing
- [ ] Implement health and readiness check endpoints
- [ ] Add structured logging throughout the system
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Support configuration via environment variables
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints

## Technical Requirements

- REST API design and implementation
- Asynchronous job processing
- Database integration (Postgres)
- Vector database integration (Qdrant)
- Embedding service integration
- Logging and monitoring
- Configuration management
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

## Dependencies

- Database setup and configuration
- Vector database setup
- Embedding provider configuration
- Object storage setup

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All API endpoints are implemented and tested
- [ ] Ingestion workers process documents reliably
- [ ] Search service returns results within performance targets
- [ ] Health checks provide accurate system status
- [ ] Logging captures all necessary information
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios

## Priority

High - Core MVP functionality

## Estimated Effort

Large (8-13 story points)
