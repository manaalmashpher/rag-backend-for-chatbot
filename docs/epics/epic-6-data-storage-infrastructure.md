# Epic 6: Data Storage & Infrastructure

## Epic Overview

Set up and configure the core data storage infrastructure including Qdrant vector database and PostgreSQL relational database with FTS for the RAG system.

## Business Value

- Provides reliable data persistence for the entire system
- Enables efficient vector and metadata storage
- Supports hybrid search capabilities through proper indexing

## User Stories

- As a system, I want to store document vectors so I can perform semantic search
- As a system, I want to store document metadata so I can track processing status
- As a system, I want to maintain lexical indexes so I can perform keyword search

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Set up Qdrant vector database with proper collection configuration
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL database with required schema and FTS indexes
- [ ] Set up proper indexing for performance

## Technical Requirements

- Qdrant vector database setup and configuration
- PostgreSQL database schema and FTS configuration
- Connection pooling and optimization

## Dependencies

- Infrastructure provisioning
- Database service accounts
- Network configuration and security

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All databases are properly configured and accessible
- [ ] FTS indexes are created and optimized
- [ ] Connection pooling is configured and tested

## Priority

High - Core MVP functionality

## Estimated Effort

Medium (5-8 story points)

## Implementation Notes

**Current Implementation:**

- Uses PostgreSQL with FTS for lexical search and metadata storage
- PostgreSQL provides robust full-text search capabilities with tsvector columns
- PostgreSQL offers excellent performance and scalability for production workloads

**Production Benefits:**

- PostgreSQL FTS provides advanced text search features with ranking
- Built-in unaccent and pg_trgm extensions for better text processing
- Superior performance for complex queries and large datasets
- Enterprise-grade reliability and data integrity features
