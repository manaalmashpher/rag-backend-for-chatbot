# Epic 6: Data Storage & Infrastructure

## Epic Overview

Set up and configure the data storage infrastructure including Qdrant vector database, SQLite relational database (with future Postgres migration path), and object storage for the complete RAG system.

## Business Value

- Provides reliable data persistence for the entire system
- Enables efficient vector and metadata storage
- Supports hybrid search capabilities through proper indexing

## User Stories

- As a system, I want to store document vectors so I can perform semantic search
- As a system, I want to store document metadata so I can track processing status
- As a system, I want to maintain lexical indexes so I can perform keyword search
- As a system, I want to store original files so I can reference them when needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Set up Qdrant vector database with proper collection configuration
- [ ] Configure SQLite database with required schema and FTS5 indexes
- [ ] Implement object storage for original file persistence
- [ ] Create database migration scripts
- [ ] Set up proper indexing for performance
- [ ] Implement data backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Configure connection pooling and optimization
- [ ] Add monitoring for database performance

## Technical Requirements

- Qdrant vector database setup and configuration
- SQLite database schema and FTS5 configuration
- Object storage setup (S3-compatible)
- Database migration and versioning
- Connection pooling and optimization
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Performance monitoring

## Dependencies

- Infrastructure provisioning
- Database and storage service accounts
- Network configuration and security

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All databases are properly configured and accessible
- [ ] Schema migrations are implemented and tested
- [ ] FTS5 indexes are created and optimized
- [ ] Object storage is configured and accessible
- [ ] Backup procedures are in place
- [ ] Performance monitoring is configured

## Priority

High - Core MVP functionality

## Estimated Effort

Medium (5-8 story points)

## Implementation Notes

**Current Implementation:**

- Uses SQLite with FTS5 for lexical search and metadata storage
- This choice was made for MVP simplicity and faster development
- SQLite provides excellent performance for the current scale and user load

**Future Migration Path:**

- Postgres migration may be considered for production scaling
- Migration scripts should be prepared for future database transition
- Current SQLite implementation is fully functional and meets all MVP requirements
