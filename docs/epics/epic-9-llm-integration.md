# Epic 9: LLM Integration - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) into the existing RAG system to transform raw search results into coherent, contextual answers, providing users with direct responses instead of requiring manual interpretation of retrieved chunks.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Current relevant functionality**: Hybrid search system that retrieves and ranks relevant document chunks using semantic vector similarity + lexical keyword matching
- **Technology stack**: Python/FastAPI backend, React frontend, Qdrant vector database, Postgres with FTS, embedding models (configurable)
- **Integration points**: Existing `/api/search` endpoint, hybrid search service, search results UI components

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being added**: LLM integration layer that takes retrieved chunks and generates natural language answers
- **How it integrates**: Extends the existing search flow: Query → Hybrid Search → LLM Synthesis → Answer Response
- **Success criteria**: Users receive direct, contextual answers to their queries instead of raw document chunks

## Stories

1. **Story 1: LLM Service Integration** - Implement LLM service with configurable provider and model selection
2. **Story 2: Answer Synthesis Pipeline** - Create pipeline to synthesize retrieved chunks into coherent answers
3. **Story 3: Enhanced Search API** - Extend search API to return both raw results and synthesized answers

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing search API remains unchanged (backward compatible)
- [ ] Database schema changes are minimal (no breaking changes)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns and design system
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable (answer generation within 3-5 seconds)
- [ ] Existing hybrid search functionality remains intact

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: LLM response quality and consistency may vary
- **Mitigation**: Implement response validation, fallback to raw results, and configurable quality thresholds
- **Rollback Plan**: Feature flag to disable LLM integration and revert to original chunk-based results

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing hybrid search functionality verified through testing
- [ ] LLM integration works with existing search flow
- [ ] API documentation updated with new response format
- [ ] No regression in existing search performance or accuracy
- [ ] LLM responses are contextually relevant and well-formed
- [ ] Configuration allows switching between raw results and synthesized answers

## Technical Considerations

**LLM Integration Approach:**

- Add LLM service layer between hybrid search and response formatting
- Support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Implement prompt engineering for consistent answer quality
- Add response caching to improve performance

**API Enhancement:**

- Extend search response to include both `chunks` and `answer` fields
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing clients
- Add configuration options for answer generation

**Performance Targets:**

- Answer generation: < 3 seconds for typical queries
- Maintain existing search latency targets (p95 ≤ 1.5s, p99 ≤ 3.0s)
- Implement intelligent caching for repeated queries

## Dependencies

- Existing hybrid search service (no changes required)
- LLM provider API access and configuration
- Prompt engineering and response validation
- UI updates to display synthesized answers

## Success Metrics

- **User Experience**: Users prefer synthesized answers over raw chunks (qualitative feedback)
- **Response Quality**: Answer relevance score ≥ 4/5 on test queries
- **Performance**: Answer generation latency p95 ≤ 3 seconds
- **Reliability**: LLM service availability ≥ 99% during testing period
