**Testing Focus:** OWASP testing, input validation tests, injection attack simulations

### 4. PERF-001: Authentication Performance Bottlenecks

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability:** Medium - Auth operations can be slow
**Impact:** High - Poor user experience and system degradation

**Description:** Slow password hashing, database queries, or JWT validation could impact system performance

**Mitigation:**

- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement connection pooling
- Use efficient hashing algorithms

- Monitor authentication metrics

**Testing Focus:** Load testing, performance profiling, database query optimization

### 5. DATA-001: Data Isolation and Privacy Violations

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability:** Medium - Organization scoping complexity
**Impact:** High - Data breach and compliance violations

**Description:** Improper organization scoping could lead to cross-tenant data access

**Mitigation:**

- Implement strict organization-based data filtering
- Add comprehensive access controls
- Test data isolation thoroughly
- Implement audit logging
- Regular security reviews

**Testing Focus:** Data isolation tests, access control verification, privacy compliance testing
