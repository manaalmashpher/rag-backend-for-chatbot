## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Migration Testing**: Full data migration with rollback procedures
- **Consistency Testing**: Cross-database data validation
- **Disaster Recovery**: Complete system failure and recovery
- **Data Integrity**: End-to-end data validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with realistic data volumes
- **Security Testing**: Database access control validation
- **Backup Testing**: Automated backup and recovery procedures

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Functional Testing**: Standard database operations
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-system connectivity
- **Monitoring Testing**: Alert and metric validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (DATA-001, TECH-001)
- High risks affecting data integrity (DATA-002)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Performance risks with monitoring in place
- Security risks with proper access controls

### Accepted Risks

- **Security alerts**: Unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalations
- **Data consistency**: Cross-database validation checks
- **Storage metrics**: Disk usage, backup completion rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
