## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Memory stress testing**: Test with 100MB+ documents
- **Data integrity testing**: Verify chunk consistency across methods
- **Corruption detection**: Test with malformed input data
- **Performance benchmarks**: Measure chunking time vs document size

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Integration testing**: Test chunking service with upload API
- **Method validation**: Test all edge cases for method selection
- **Error handling**: Test with various malformed inputs
- **Metadata consistency**: Verify all chunk metadata fields

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Functional testing**: Test all 8 chunking methods
- **Regression testing**: Ensure existing functionality works
- **User experience testing**: Test method selection interface

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - **Memory exhaustion and data corruption**
- High risks affecting integration - **API integration complexity**

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Minimal risks (score 1) can be accepted with basic monitoring

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance metrics**: Chunking time, memory usage, document size
- **Error rates**: Chunking failures, method validation errors
- **Data quality**: Chunk metadata consistency, hash uniqueness
- **Business KPIs**: User method selection patterns, chunk quality

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New chunking methods added
- Performance issues reported
- Integration changes made
- Large document processing issues
- User feedback on chunk quality

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### PERF-001: Memory Exhaustion

**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:

- Implement streaming processing for large documents
- Add memory usage monitoring and limits
- Implement document size validation before processing
- Add garbage collection triggers

**Testing Requirements**:

- Load testing with 100MB+ documents
- Memory profiling during chunking
- Stress testing with concurrent requests

### DATA-001: Chunk Data Corruption

**Strategy**: Preventive + Detective
**Actions**:

- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Add checksum verification for chunk integrity
- Implement atomic chunk creation
- Add data validation before storage

**Testing Requirements**:

- Corruption injection testing
- Data integrity verification tests
- Checksum validation tests

### TECH-001: Integration Complexity

**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:

- Implement comprehensive integration tests
- Add API contract validation
- Implement graceful fallback mechanisms
- Add detailed error logging

**Testing Requirements**:

- End-to-end integration testing
- API contract testing
- Error scenario testing
- Performance testing under load

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### 1. Testing Priority

- **Immediate**: Memory and data integrity tests
- **High**: Integration and performance tests
- **Medium**: Functional and regression tests

### 2. Development Focus

- **Code review emphasis**: Memory management, error handling
- **Additional validation**: Input sanitization, method validation
- **Security controls**: Data integrity, input validation

### 3. Deployment Strategy

- **Phased rollout**: Start with small documents, monitor performance
- **Feature flags**: Enable/disable chunking methods based on performance
- **Rollback procedures**: Quick rollback if memory issues occur

### 4. Monitoring Setup

- **Metrics to track**: Memory usage, chunking time, error rates
- **Alerts to configure**: Memory threshold, error rate spikes
- **Dashboard requirements**: Performance metrics, error tracking
