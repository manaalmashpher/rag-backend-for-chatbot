## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Performance Load Testing**: Test with realistic query volumes and complex queries
- **Vector Search Stress Testing**: Test Qdrant performance under load
- **Latency Benchmarking**: Validate p95 ≤ 1.5s, p99 ≤ 3.0s targets

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Fusion Algorithm Testing**: Test with known good/bad result sets
- **Security Testing**: Input validation and injection testing
- **Database Performance Testing**: FTS5 query optimization validation

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end search flow
- **Edge Case Testing**: Empty results, single source, malformed queries
- **Regression Testing**: Standard functional test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- TECH-001: Vector search performance must meet latency targets
- All high-risk security vulnerabilities must be mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Database bottlenecks with monitoring and caching
- TECH-002: Fusion complexity with comprehensive testing
- Medium risks with compensating controls

### Accepted Risks

- Low risks with monitoring in place
- Performance risks during MVP phase (reference-only testing)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**: Search latency (p95, p99), query throughput
- **Security Alerts**: Unusual query patterns, injection attempts
- **Error Rates**: Qdrant connection failures, database timeouts
- **Business KPIs**: Search success rate, user satisfaction

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Sentence Transformers model changes
