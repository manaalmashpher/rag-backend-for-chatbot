## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **SEC-001**: Security testing for file upload endpoint
  - Penetration testing with malicious files
  - File type validation testing
  - Size limit enforcement testing
  - Input sanitization testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **PERF-001**: Performance testing for embedding generation

  - Load testing with large documents
  - Embedding provider timeout testing
  - Memory usage monitoring during processing

- **DATA-001**: Data integrity testing

  - End-to-end data flow validation
  - Transaction rollback testing
  - Partial failure recovery testing

- **TECH-001**: Integration testing
  - Service-to-service communication testing
  - Database connection failure testing
  - Qdrant connectivity testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **PERF-002/003**: Database performance testing

  - Query performance testing
  - Index efficiency testing
  - Concurrent access testing

- **SEC-002**: Input validation testing
  - Boundary value testing
  - Invalid input handling testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting security/data (SEC-001, DATA-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls (PERF-002, PERF-003, SEC-002, OPS-001, DATA-002)
- Low risks with monitoring in place (TECH-002, PERF-004, BUS-001)

### Accepted Risks

- TECH-002: Chunking complexity - Acceptable given MVP scope
- PERF-004: Object storage performance - Acceptable with monitoring
- BUS-001: Long ingestion UX - Acceptable for MVP

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance metrics**: Embedding generation time, Qdrant query latency, Postgres FTS performance
- **Security alerts**: File upload anomalies, suspicious file types, authentication failures
- **Error rates**: Ingestion failures, service timeouts, database connection issues
- **Business KPIs**: Document processing success rate, user satisfaction with upload experience

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New file types are added to supported formats
- Embedding provider is changed
- Database schema is modified
- New chunking methods are implemented
- Performance targets are not met
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### SEC-001: File Upload Security Vulnerabilities

**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive file type validation beyond MIME type checking
- Add virus scanning for uploaded files
- Implement file size limits and rate limiting
- Use secure file storage with proper access controls
- Add input sanitization for all file metadata

**Testing Focus**: Penetration testing, fuzzing, malicious file upload testing

### PERF-001: Embedding Generation Performance Bottleneck

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - External API calls with rate limits and latency
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause timeouts and poor user experience

**Mitigation**:

- Implement async processing with job queues
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement caching for repeated embeddings
- Add progress tracking and user feedback
- Consider batch processing for multiple chunks

**Testing Focus**: Load testing, timeout testing, performance monitoring

### DATA-001: Data Loss During Ingestion Process

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex multi-step process with external dependencies
**Impact**: High - Could result in lost documents or corrupted data

**Mitigation**:

- Implement transaction management across services
- Add comprehensive error handling and rollback procedures
- Implement data validation at each step
- Add backup and recovery procedures
- Implement idempotent operations where possible

**Testing Focus**: Chaos engineering, failure injection, data integrity validation

### TECH-001: Complex Multi-Service Integration

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Multiple external services and databases
**Impact**: High - Could cause system-wide failures or data inconsistency

**Mitigation**:

- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Implement graceful degradation
- Add health checks for all dependencies
- Implement proper error handling and recovery

**Testing Focus**: Integration testing, service failure testing, end-to-end testing

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Actions (Before Development)

1. **Security Review**: Conduct security review of file upload implementation
2. **Performance Planning**: Design async processing architecture
3. **Error Handling**: Define comprehensive error handling strategy
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Plan monitoring and alerting infrastructure

### During Development

1. **Code Reviews**: Focus on security and error handling
2. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test suite covering all risks
3. **Documentation**: Document all error scenarios and recovery procedures
4. **Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring and alerting

### Post-Deployment

1. **Monitoring**: Track all identified risk metrics
2. **Incident Response**: Have procedures for handling each risk scenario
3. **Regular Reviews**: Update risk profile based on real-world data
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Address any new risks that emerge

## Conclusion

Story 1.1 presents moderate to high risk due to its complexity and multiple external dependencies. The primary concerns are security vulnerabilities in file upload and performance bottlenecks in embedding generation. With proper mitigation strategies and comprehensive testing, these risks can be managed effectively.

The risk score of 68/100 indicates that while there are significant risks, they are manageable with appropriate controls and monitoring. The story should proceed with implementation while addressing the high-priority risks identified.
